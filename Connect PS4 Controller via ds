If you still want to connect using ds4drv here is a video tutorial on how to do it or you can follow the steps bellow:

    First, you have to make sure you can connect your PS4 controller with ds4drv. You can do it 1 of 2 ways and you only need to do this once.
        Manually by following this instructions
        Automatically by running py3ps4c init (if you are using python3) or py2ps4c init (if you are using python2) in your terminal.

    (Optional) connect your controller directly to the computer's Bluetooth module. Once successful, disconnect the controller. If you don't do this, in the next step you may see this error: Unable to connect to detected device: Failed to set operational mode: [Errno 107] Transport endpoint is not connected

    Now start sudo ds4drv and press SHARE + PS4 button on your controller. If pairing fails, you want to try in again, it should eventually connect.
