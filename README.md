# EGRobot

# This project is a construction project assigned to the Epsilon Gamma pledge class to create a robot that can pick up and collect trash, be controlled via bluetooth, and can process voice commands. 

# Using a Raspberry Pi 4 B+ 2GB Ram, we attempt to create, test, and implement these features with processing done on the former mentioned hardware. 

# Teams have been made to work on the software components mentioned previously.

# MOTORS - Brian, Tim, Mark 

# SPEECH RECOGNITION - Omir, Ryan 

# BLUETOOTH CONTROL - Luke, Alan 

# ROBOTIC ARM TO PICK UP AND STORE TRASH - **EVERYONE

# Development code and latest updates/commits are being pushed to the dev branch. For any software developers on this project, PLEASE DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN until testing and confirmation that code works as intended and runs on Raspberry Pi. 

# Linux virtual environments have been set up for developers to write code in using Thonny IDE, Raspberry Pi SSH access has been granted to members of the project to pull code from repo, and run on Raspberry Pi to test their features. 

# Raspberry Pi is connected to 'eduroam' Wi-Fi and requires host computer to be on the same Wi-Fi in order to SSH. Username is 'alanlee' and hostname/IP address is found using 'hostname -I' command. Password for SSH authnetication is '6ft'.
